# direct-marketing
This repository contains standard instances for the direct marketing with targeted offers optimization problem.

The instances without canibalism were made by Nobibon, Leus and Spieksma (2011). Further details can be found on the [present article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2010.10.019).

The instances with canibalism were proposed by Souza (2018). The canibalism consists in the addition of a new constraint to the original problem, where a pair of products are competitors, meaning that only one of them can be chosen by the clients.

Each instance can be identified by its group, hurdle rate, number of products, budget and the number of offers that the client can receive.
